## About

Grafana Loki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log
aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It is designed to be very cost
effective and easy to operate. It does not index the contents of the logs, but
rather a set of labels for each log stream. <https://grafana.com/oss/loki/>
